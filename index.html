            <h1> Why Warm Ups?</h1>
            <p>I have been using written out warm up booklets for my pupils for over twenty years now and my colleagues were forever telling me I need to get them into print and share them. The lockdown in 2020 gave me the time and space to do so and their success has left me humbled and grateful.</p>
            <h2>TO TEACHERS:</h2>
            <p>In my many years of teaching and inheriting pupils from other teachers, one of my first questions to an existing learner has always been, 'What would you normally play to warm up?' I am heartened when I hear their response to be 'long notes' but, in my experience, asking a pupil to practise long notes often produces a random selection of long tones played without any thought to the technique or production of that said long note and my sceptical mind doubts if this is a regular part of the said pupil's practice routine! If you expand upon the long note exercises and make them hard enough that they require practice between lessons to be able to play them, then you will hear immediately whether your pupil has practised their tone work from week to week, and their developing tonal control and dexterity within their sound will improve as a result, over time.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I have written these series of books to cover learners from their first three notes through to diploma level; ensuring their foundations are set from the outset with consistent and thorough guidance alongside the general syllabus requirements of the major examination boards, with clear and accessible guidance for each exercise.</p>
            <br>
            <p >I have, in general, not stipulated metronome speeds, dynamics or breathing within the exercises so that you can add your own, according to your student's learning requirements</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info-box">
            <h2>TO PUPILS:</h2>
            <p>Warm ups are the most important part of your practice. If you don't have a beautiful sound, it doesn't matter how fast you can play or how musically you interpret your pieces, they will not sound great.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Your tone is your voice and if your sound is weak, it won't travel beyond your music stand and no-one will be able to hear you; and if your sound isn't good, why would anyone want to? Take ownership of your sound and use your warm ups to find your own unique and beautiful voice so that you can tell your tonal story through your music and charm everyone that hears you!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Everyone's sound is special to them and depends on various things: the shape of your lips, your teeth, the cavity within your mouth, your technique, your breathing, your diaphragm engagement, your airspeed, and your determination to be the best you can be. Do as your teacher instructs in terms of correct breathing, embouchure and posture; do your warm ups at the start of each and every practice that you do, practice your scales and become the best flute player you could possibly be!</p>

        <img class="bio-image" src="./images/Joss-profile.jpeg">
        <div class="bio-text"> <p>Joss was inspired to take up the flute at the age of five after hearing it played at her school speech day. Her father, a pianist and music teacher, brought her one home to try and the rest is, as they say, history!

            Growing up, Joss studied with some of the UK's leading flute professors, Gareth Morris, Edward Walker, Trevor Wye, Clare Southworth, Kathryn Lukas, Christopher Hyde-Smith, Eddie Beckett, and the main influences in her playing and technique, John Francis and Peter Lloyd. At the age of thirteen, she made her solo London debut with The London Symphony Orchestra playing Mozart's G Major Flute Concerto as a finalist in the Shell/LSO Scholarship.
            
            After studying at Chetham's School of Music in Manchester, Joss gained a scholarship to study at The Royal College of Music, followed by further studies at The Guildhall School of Music and Drama. As a student, she gained 2nd prize in the wind finals of the BBC's Young Musician of the Year, 2nd prize in the Shell/LSO Scholarship and was a principal flute with the European Community Youth Orchestra. Her flute playing has taken her all over the world as soloist, an orchestral and chamber musician, a pit player in the West End and as an educator.
            
            Joss is based in London where her teaching is in great demand. Her pupils regularly achieve success, gaining music scholarships to study at some of London's most prestigious schools and winning prizes in competitions. She runs various flute choirs and has been asked to guest conduct at various others around the country.
            
            Joss runs an annual residential course for adults at Benslow Music Trust in Hitchin, entitled 'The Complete Flautist'. The course consists of four days of comprehensive flute study where participants are guided through all aspects of flute technique and have the opportunity to their chosen repertoire in master classes with Joss and Benslow's resident accompanist, Stephen Meakins. The days are interspersed with small group ensemble playing and massed flute choir sessions.
            
            Joss is a member of the flute quartet 'Festive Flutes'. The quartet regularly perform together and deliver flute choir workshops at Flute Conventions and educational establishments across the UK. They have recorded two albums and have several tracks available for download from iTunes.</p></div>
